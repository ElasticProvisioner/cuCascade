/**
 * @brief Central manager for coordinating data repositories across multiple pipelines.
 *
 * data_repository_manager serves as the top-level coordinator for data management in the
 * Sirius system. It maintains a collection of idata_repository instances, each associated
 * with a specific pipeline, and provides centralized services for:
 *
 * - Repository lifecycle management (creation, access, cleanup)
 * - Cross-pipeline data batch coordination
 * - Unique batch ID generation
 * - Global eviction and memory management policies
 *
 * Architecture:
 * ```
 * data_repository_manager
 * ├── Pipeline 1 → idata_repository (FIFO/LRU/Priority)
 * ├── Pipeline 2 → idata_repository (FIFO/LRU/Priority)
 * └── Pipeline N → idata_repository (FIFO/LRU/Priority)
 * ```
 *
 * The manager abstracts the complexity of multi-pipeline data management and provides
 * a unified interface for higher-level components like the GPU executor and memory manager.
 *
 * @note All operations are thread-safe and can be called concurrently from multiple
 *       pipeline execution threads.
